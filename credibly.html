              <br>
              <p>Throughout the summer of 2021, I worked at <a href="https://credibly.com/" target="_blank">Credibly</a>  a UX research intern. Credibly is a finance-tech lending company that leverages cutting-edge data science, technology, partner relations, and customer support to provide business owners with accelerated access to rigt-sized capital solutions. </p>
            <h2><strong>Outcome</strong></h2>
                <p>During my time at Credibly, I gained exposure to many different in house projects and as a result, I was able to learn a lot about the many methods that their marketing team employs. Due to NDA, I cannot share all the specifics here, but these are some impacts that I made in the teamâ€™s projects during my time with them.</p>
